# LAST-PASS Clone

__One Password to rule them all, One Password to find them, One Password to bring them all. and in the darkness bind them.__


## FRONTEND
    Create a single functional component which will check for authentication state
        of the user before sending the API request to the backend.
        We are using React-Redux for state-management and Redux-persist 
        for retaining current state after page refresh.
