In here I have created on redux folder 
wherein I everything just like our "coursera" course
but after setting this app into production 
I would make different folders for different
elements ie "auth" folder for handling authentication
& "lp_data" folder for handling lastPass data.
## Notes:
--currently the out of the CRUD operations only retrieve is completed with authentications

## complete PATCH request:-
-- {
    "id": 1,
    "ogUser": 3,
    "name_of_website": "Netflix 2",
    "url_of_website": "https://www.netflix.com/",
    "username_for_website": "shikamaru",
    "password_for_website": "test@1234",
    "notes": "The password is test@1234",
    "username": "Shikamaru"
}
